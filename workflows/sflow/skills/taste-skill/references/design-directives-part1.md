## 4. DESIGN ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES (Bias Correction)

LLMs default to clichés. Override these defaults proactively. Each rule has a context-aware override path.

### 4.1 Typography
- Display / Headlines: Default `text-4xl md:text-6xl tracking-tighter leading-none`.
- Body / Paragraphs: Default `text-base text-gray-600 leading-relaxed max-w-[65ch]`.
- Sans font choice:
  - Discouraged as default: `Inter`. Pick `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, `Satoshi`, or a brand-appropriate serif first.
  - Override: Inter is acceptable when the user explicitly asks for a neutral / standard / Linear-style feel, or when the brief is a public-sector / accessibility-first site.
- Pairings to know: `Geist` + `Geist Mono`, `Satoshi` + `JetBrains Mono`, `Cabinet Grotesk` + `Inter Tight`, `GT America` + `IBM Plex Mono`.

- SERIF DISCIPLINE (VERY DISCOURAGED AS DEFAULT):
  - Serif is very discouraged as the default font for any project. "It feels creative / premium / editorial" is NOT a reason to reach for serif. The agent's default mental model that "creative brief = serif" is the single most-tested AI tell in production rounds.
  - Serif is only acceptable when ONE of these is explicitly true:
    - The brand brief literally names a serif font, OR
    - The aesthetic family is genuinely editorial / luxury / publication / manuscript / heritage / vintage AND you can articulate why this specific serif fits this specific brand
  - For everything else (creative agency, design studio, modern brand, premium consumer, portfolio, lifestyle), default sans-serif display (Geist Display, ABC Diatype, Söhne Breit, Cabinet Grotesk Display, Migra Sans, GT Walsheim, Inter Display, PP Neue Montreal). Sans display fonts are not "boring" — they are the default for the same reason black is the default in fashion.
  - EMPHASIS RULE (related): When you want to emphasize a word within a headline (the kinetic "and `spatial` design" type move), use italic or bold of the SAME font. Do NOT inject a random serif word into a sans headline (or vice versa) just to add visual interest. Mixed-family emphasis is amateur. Italic/bold emphasis in the same family is the right move.
  - Specifically BANNED as defaults: `Fraunces` and `Instrument_Serif` (the two LLM-favorite display serifs).
  - If a serif is justified (rare, per the above), rotate from this pool, do NOT reuse the same serif across consecutive projects: PP Editorial New, GT Sectra Display, Cardinal Grotesque, Reckless Neue, Tiempos Headline, Recoleta, Cormorant Garamond, Playfair Display, EB Garamond, IvyPresto, Migra, Editorial Old, Saol Display, Söhne Breit Kursiv, Domaine Display, Canela, Schnyder, Tobias, NB Architekt, ITC Galliard.

- ITALIC DESCENDER CLEARANCE (mandatory): When italic is used in display type and the word contains a descender letter (`y g j p q`), `leading-[1]` or `leading-none` will clip the descender. Use `leading-[1.1]` minimum and add `pb-1` or `mb-1` reserve on the wrapping element. Audit every italic word in display headlines before shipping.

### 4.2 Color Calibration
- Max 1 accent color. Saturation < 80% by default.
- THE LILA RULE: The "AI Purple / Blue glow" aesthetic is discouraged as a default. No automatic purple button glows, no random neon gradients. Use neutral bases (Zinc / Slate / Stone) with high-contrast singular accents (Emerald, Electric Blue, Deep Rose, Burnt Orange, etc.).
- Override: if the brand or brief explicitly asks for purple / violet / lila, embrace it. But execute with intent: consistent palette, harmonised neutrals, restrained gradients. Not generic AI gradient slop.
- One palette per project. Do not fluctuate between warm and cool grays within the same project.
- COLOR CONSISTENCY LOCK (mandatory): Once an accent color is chosen for a page, it is used on the WHOLE page. A warm-grey site does not suddenly get a blue CTA in section 7. A rose-accented site does not get a teal status badge in the footer. Pick one accent, lock it, audit every component before shipping.

- PREMIUM-CONSUMER PALETTE BAN (mandatory, second-most-recurring AI-tell):
  - For premium-consumer briefs (cookware, wellness, artisan, luxury, heritage craft, DTC home goods, etc.) the LLM default is warm beige/cream + brass/clay/oxblood/ochre + espresso/ink dark text. Concretely banned hex families as default backgrounds and accents:
    - Backgrounds: `#f5f1ea`, `#f7f5f1`, `#fbf8f1`, `#efeae0`, `#ece6db`, `#faf7f1`, `#e8dfcb` (all "warm paper / cream / chalk / bone")
    - Accents: `#b08947`, `#b6553a`, `#9a2436`, `#9c6e2a`, `#bc7c3a`, `#7d5621` (all "brass / clay / oxblood / ochre")
    - Text: `#1a1714`, `#1a1814`, `#1b1814` (all "espresso / warm near-black")
  - This palette is BANNED as the default reach for premium-consumer briefs. Every premium-consumer site you have ever shipped uses this exact palette. The brand becomes invisible.
  - Default alternatives (rotate, do not reuse):
    - Cold Luxury: silver-grey + chrome + smoke (think Tesla, Apple Watch Hermes-without-the-leather)
    - Forest: deep green + bone + amber accent (think Filson, Patagonia premium)
    - Black and Tan: true off-black + warm tan, sharp contrast, no beige
    - Cobalt + Cream: saturated blue against a single neutral, no brass
    - Terracotta + Slate: warm rust against cool grey, no brass
    - Olive + Brick + Paper: muted olive plus brick-red accent
    - Pure monochrome + single saturated pop: off-white + off-black + one bright accent (electric blue, emerald, hot pink, etc.)
  - Palette-rotation rule: if the previous premium-consumer project you generated used the beige+brass family, this one MUST use a different family. Do not ship the same warm-craft palette twice in a row.
  - Override: the beige+brass+espresso palette is acceptable ONLY when the brand brief explicitly names those colors, or when the brand identity is genuinely vintage / artisan / warm-craft AND you can articulate why this specific palette fits this specific brand. Default-reaching for it because "this is a cookware brief" is banned.

### 4.3 Layout Diversification
- ANTI-CENTER BIAS: Centered Hero / H1 sections are avoided when `DESIGN_VARIANCE > 4`. Force "Split Screen" (50/50), "Left-aligned content / right-aligned asset", "Asymmetric white-space", or scroll-pinned structures.
- Override: centered hero is OK for editorial / manifesto / launch-announcement briefs where the message itself is the design.

### 4.4 Materiality, Shadows, Cards
- Use cards ONLY when elevation communicates real hierarchy. Otherwise group with `border-t`, `divide-y`, or negative space.
- When a shadow is used, tint it to the background hue. No pure-black drop shadows on light backgrounds.
- For `VISUAL_DENSITY > 7`: generic card containers are banned. Data metrics breathe in plain layout.
- SHAPE CONSISTENCY LOCK (mandatory): Pick ONE corner-radius scale for the page and stick to it. Options: all-sharp (radius 0), all-soft (radius 12-16px), all-pill (full radius for interactive). Mixed systems are allowed only when there is a documented rule (e.g. "buttons are full-pill, cards are 16px, inputs are 8px") and that rule is followed everywhere. Round buttons in a square layout, or square cards on a pill-button page, is broken design.

### 4.5 Interactive UI States
LLMs default to "static successful state only." Always implement full cycles:
- Loading: Skeletal loaders matching the final layout's shape. Avoid generic circular spinners.
- Empty States: Beautifully composed; indicate how to populate.
- Error States: Clear, inline (forms), or contextual (toasts only for transient).
- Tactile Feedback: On `:active`, use `-translate-y-[1px]` or `scale-[0.98]` to simulate a physical push.
- BUTTON CONTRAST CHECK (mandatory, a11y): Before shipping any button, verify the button text is readable against the button background. White button + white text, `bg-white` CTA with `text-white` label, transparent button against the page background with no border → all banned. Audit every CTA: contrast ratio WCAG AA min (4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large text 18px+). Same rule applies to ghost buttons over photographic backgrounds (use a backdrop, scrim, or stroke).
- CTA BUTTON WRAP BAN (mandatory): Button text MUST fit on one line at desktop. If a label like "VIEW SELECTED WORK" wraps to 2 or 3 lines, the button is broken. Fix by EITHER shortening the label (3 words max for primary CTAs, ideally 1-2) OR widening the button (do not artificially constrain `max-width` on CTAs). Wrapped CTAs at desktop are a Pre-Flight Fail.
- NO DUPLICATE CTA INTENT (mandatory): Two CTAs with the same intent on one page is a Pre-Flight Fail. Examples of same intent: "Get in touch" + "Contact us" + "Let's talk" + "Start a project" + "Start something" + "Reach out" = all "contact" intent → pick ONE label and use it everywhere on the page (nav, hero, footer). Same for "Try free" + "Get started" + "Sign up free" (all "signup" intent) and "View work" + "See selected work" + "Browse projects" (all "portfolio" intent). One label per intent.
- FORM CONTRAST CHECK (mandatory, a11y): Form inputs, placeholder text, focus rings, helper text, and error text all pass WCAG AA contrast against the section background. Light placeholders on a near-white form, white form on white page section, form labels grayer than 4.5:1 contrast → all banned. Audit every form before shipping.

### 4.6 Data & Form Patterns
- Label ABOVE input. Helper text optional but present in markup. Error text BELOW input. Standard `gap-2` for input blocks.
- No placeholder-as-label. Ever.
