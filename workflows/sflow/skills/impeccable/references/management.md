# Management Commands

## Pin / Unpin

**Pin** creates a standalone shortcut so `/<command>` invokes `/impeccable <command>` directly. **Unpin** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
node .opencode/skills/impeccable/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.

## Hooks

`/impeccable hooks <on|off|status|ignore-rule|ignore-file|ignore-value|reset>` manages the design detector hook for this project. The hook auto-runs the detector after direct UI file edits and surfaces findings as system reminders. Full flow is in [reference/hooks.md](reference/hooks.md); load it when the user invokes `/impeccable hooks` with any argument.
