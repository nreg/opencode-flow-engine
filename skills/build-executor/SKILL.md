# Build Executor

This skill controls the implementation phase of `sflow`.

It borrows the spirit of Superpowers execution discipline, but uses `execution-contract.md` as the workflow authority.

## Use This Skill When

Invoke this skill when the user says things like:

- "implement this now"
- "start coding"
- "execute batch 1"
- "continue implementation"
- "finish the build work"

Only use it after the contract exists and the user has approved it.

## Required Inputs

Read before implementation:

- `execution-contract.md` (unless workflow is `tweak` — tweak edits config/doc files directly without a contract)
- `tasks.md` (unless workflow is `tweak`)
- relevant `specs/` (unless workflow is `tweak`)
- relevant `design.md` (unless workflow is `tweak`)

### Workflow Mode Check

Before anything else, check the current workflow mode from `.sflow/state.json`:

- If `tweak`: skip contract/spec input requirements. Proceed directly to edit the target files.
- If `hotfix` or `full`: follow the standard contract-first discipline.

### Config Check

Before determining execution mode, check the project configuration in `.sflow/config.json` (if it exists):
- If `execution.inlineThreshold` is specified, use it as the inline threshold; otherwise use default (3)

## Core Laws

### Law 1: Contract First

Do not treat chat history as the source of truth once implementation begins.

The execution contract is the approved handoff artifact.

### Law 2: No Production Code Without a Failing Test First (TDD Iron Law)

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

This is not a preference. It is the execution discipline.

**The RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Cycle:**

| Phase | Action | Evidence Required |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **RED** | Write the failing test | Run it, see it fail for the expected reason |
| **GREEN** | Write minimal production code | Run test, see it pass (and all others still pass) |
| **REFACTOR** | Clean up code while tests stay green | Full suite still passing after cleanup |

**Red Flags — STOP and return to RED:**

If you catch yourself thinking any of these, you are violating the TDD Iron Law:

- "Just a quick implementation first, test later"
- "This is simple enough, I'll test after"
- "Let me write the code and the tests together"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "The test setup is complex, let me just code it"
- "I already know it works, testing is redundant"
- "Just this one time without tests"
- "The implementation will inform the test design" (it won't — it will validate whatever you built)

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Write the test first.**

### Law 3: Review Before Drift

Use review gates between meaningful execution batches.

Block progress on:

- logic defects
- spec violations
- missing required tests
- unintended scope expansion

### Law 4: Rewind on Contract Break

Return to `specifying` or `bridging` if:

- new behavior appears
- interfaces change materially
- design assumptions fail
- the current artifacts no longer define the intended implementation

## Execution Mode Selection

Before starting implementation, determine the execution mode:

### Automatic Selection Criteria

1. Count total tasks in the execution contract's task batches
2. Analyze cross-module dependencies (does any task modify files in > 2 modules?)
3. Analyze risk indicators:
   - Does any task introduce a new public API, schema, or configuration change?
   - Are there open questions or dependencies on unimplemented behavior?
4. Decision:
   - Tasks ≤ 3 AND no cross-module dependencies → **Inline mode**
   - Tasks > 3 AND all tasks within the same module AND no risk indicators AND total estimated effort ≤ 15 minutes → **Batch Inline mode**
   - Otherwise → **SDD mode** (default)

### Reporting

Before executing the first task, report to the user:
- Selected mode and reasoning
- Total task count
- Cross-module dependency analysis (if any)
- Risk indicators that prevent Batch Inline (if any)
- Offer user override: "You can override this by saying 'use SDD', 'use inline', or 'use batch inline'"

### User Override

If the user explicitly requests a mode, use it regardless of automatic selection. Record the override in the progress ledger.

## Batch Inline Execution

Batch Inline is for low-risk, same-module tasks where the overhead of one subagent per task outweighs the value. The current agent executes the batch directly, but the TDD Iron Law still applies.

### When to use Batch Inline

- Total tasks > 3 but the entire batch stays within one module or directory
- No task introduces a new public API, schema, or configuration change
- No open questions or dependencies on unimplemented behavior
- Total estimated effort ≤ 15 minutes

### Batch Inline Procedure

1. **Announce the mode** and the task range being batched.
2. **Write or update the failing test** for the first code change in the batch.
3. **Run the test** and confirm it fails for the expected reason.
4. **Implement the minimal changes** across the batch to make tests pass.
5. **Run the full relevant test suite** and confirm green.
6. **Refactor** if needed while keeping tests green.
7. **Run a lightweight checkpoint** before moving to the next batch or closure:
   - All declared files exist and are non-empty.
   - No placeholder markers remain.
   - At least one relevant test passed.
   - No unintended files were modified.
8. **Report checkpoint result** to the user.

### Batch Inline Boundaries

If any task in the planned batch:
- touches more than one module,
- involves schema, API, or configuration changes, or
- has open questions or unimplemented dependencies,

downgrade to **Inline** or **SDD** and report the reason.

## Subagent-Driven Development (SDD) Workflow

For changes with more than one execution batch, use the SDD workflow: dispatch a fresh implementer subagent per task, review each task (spec compliance + code quality), and conduct a broad final review after all tasks are complete.

### Pre-Flight Plan Review

Before dispatching Task 1, scan the execution contract and tasks for conflicts:

- Tasks that contradict each other or the contract's intent lock
- Anything the spec explicitly mandates that the review rubric treats as a defect
- Present all findings to the user as one batched question before execution begins

If the scan is clean, proceed without comment.

### Worktree Isolation (Optional, Recommended)

Before starting execution, check the current branch:

1. Run: `git branch --show-current`
2. If on `main` or `master` branch:
   - Create worktree: `git worktree add ../<project>-<change-name> -b <change-name>`
   - Change the working directory to the worktree path before any file operations
   - All subsequent commands must run from the worktree directory
3. If already on a feature branch → proceed normally
4. After all batches complete, remind the user:
   - "Worktree ready for merge. Suggested commands:"
   - `git merge <change-name>`
   - `git worktree remove <worktree-path>`

If `git worktree` is unavailable → silently skip, continue in current directory.

### Model Selection Strategy

Use the least powerful model that can handle each role:

- **Mechanical implementation** (isolated functions, clear specs, 1-2 files): use a fast, cheap model
- **Integration and judgment** (multi-file coordination, pattern matching, debugging): use a standard model
- **Architecture and design** (requires broad codebase understanding or design judgment): use the most capable model
- **Review tasks**: match the model to the diff's size, complexity, and risk
- **Final whole-branch review**: use the most capable model

**Always specify the model explicitly when dispatching a subagent.** An omitted model inherits the session's model, defeating cost optimization.

### Per-Task Loop

For each task in the execution batch:

1. **Dispatch implementer**: Use the template at `skills/build-executor/implementer-prompt.md` to craft the dispatch. Extract the task brief. Compose the dispatch prompt with: (a) where this task fits, (b) the brief path, (c) interfaces/decisions from prior tasks, (d) report file path.
2. **Handle implementer response**:
   - **DONE**: Generate review package and dispatch task reviewer
   - **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS**: Read concerns, assess, then review
   - **NEEDS_CONTEXT**: Provide missing context, re-dispatch
   - **BLOCKED**: Assess blocker — if task requires more reasoning, re-dispatch with better model; if plan is wrong, escalate to user
3. **Review**: Dispatch task reviewer using `skills/build-executor/task-reviewer-prompt.md`. Reviewer returns spec compliance verdict + code quality verdict.
4. **Fix**: If Critical or Important issues found, dispatch fix subagent. Re-review after fixes.
5. **Mark complete**: Append one line to `.sflow/progress.md`: `Task N: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, review clean)`

### File Handoffs

Keep your context lean by handing artifacts as files, not pasted text:

- **Task brief**: Extract task text to a uniquely named file
- **Report file**: Named after the brief (`task-N-report.md`) — implementer writes full report there, returns only status summary
- **Review package**: Write diff to a unique file; reviewer reads one file instead of running git commands

### Progress Ledger

Track progress in `.sflow/progress.md`. At skill start, check for an existing ledger — tasks marked complete there are done, do not re-dispatch them. After each clean review, append one line to the ledger.

The ledger survives context compaction. If `git clean -fdx` destroys it, recover from `git log`.

After each batch completes and the progress ledger is updated, sync `.sflow/state.json`:

1. Increment `batches_completed` counter
2. Update `last_transition` timestamp

### Dispatch Instructions for Implementer Subagents

Refer to `skills/build-executor/implementer-prompt.md` for the complete dispatch template. Key principles:

- Subagent works from its task brief, not the whole plan
- Subagent follows TDD (the rules embedded in this build-executor)
- Subagent self-reviews before reporting back
- Subagent escalates when stuck (BLOCKED, NEEDS_CONTEXT) rather than guessing
- Subagent writes its full report to the report file, returns only status summary

### Dispatch Instructions for Reviewer Subagents

Refer to `skills/build-executor/task-reviewer-prompt.md` for the complete dispatch template. Key principles:

- Reviewer gets the task brief, the implementer's report, and the diff file — nothing more
- Reviewer does NOT trust the implementer's report; it verifies against the diff
- Reviewer returns two verdicts: spec compliance and code quality
- Reviewer's output is the report itself — no preamble, no process narration

### Handling Reviewer ⚠️ Items

The task reviewer may report "⚠️ Cannot verify from diff" items — requirements in unchanged code or spanning tasks. Resolve each yourself before marking the task complete. If real gaps, treat as failed spec review — send back to implementer and re-review.

## Inline Execution Mode

For small changes (≤ 3 tasks, no cross-module dependencies). Executes in the current session without subagent dispatch.

### Per-Task Loop (Inline)

1. **Read task**: Extract the task from the plan
2. **Write failing test**: Follow the task's TDD phase 1 — write the exact test code specified
3. **Confirm failure**: Run the test, verify it fails for the expected reason
4. **Implement**: Follow the task's TDD phase 3 — write the exact implementation code specified
5. **Confirm green**: Run the full test suite, verify all tests pass
6. **Checkpoint review**: Before proceeding to the next task:
   - Verify the task's done-when criteria from the execution contract
   - Verify the task output against its spec requirements (SHALL/MUST statements)
   - If any check fails → STOP, report the gap, ask user how to proceed
7. **Commit**: Follow the task's commit step
8. **Progress ledger**: Append task completion to `.sflow/progress.md`

### Inline → SDD Escalation

If an inline task hits a BLOCKED state (test failure after 3 fix attempts, or the implementation requires changes outside the task's declared file paths), suggest escalating to SDD mode:
- "This task is more complex than estimated. Switch to SDD mode for subagent-driven implementation?"

## Execution Modes Summary

| Aspect | SDD Mode | Inline Mode |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Task count | > 3 or cross-module | ≤ 3, single module |
| Implementation | Subagent per task | Current session |
| Review | Reviewer subagent per task | Checkpoint review by governor |
| Model selection | Per-task model routing | Single model |
| Progress ledger | Yes | Yes |
| TDD Iron Law | Yes | Yes |
| Escalation | → bug-investigator | → SDD mode or bug-investigator |

## Progress Reporting

During implementation, keep reporting against the contract:

- which batch is active
- which test or verification step is next
- whether scope drift has appeared

If drift appears, stop and route backward instead of improvising new behavior.

## Tweak Mode: Direct Edit

When workflow is `tweak`, build-executor operates in direct edit mode:
1. Skip TDD Iron Law (no test-first requirement for config/doc changes)
2. Apply changes directly to target files
3. Verify file integrity after each change (file exists, non-empty, valid syntax)
4. No batch-based execution — apply all changes in sequence
5. Reference DP-4 for execution mode confirmation
6. Reference DP-5 for debug escalation if changes fail

## Completion Standard

Do not report completion until:

- required tests pass
- contract obligations are satisfied
- review blockers are resolved
- all batches have been reviewed (per-task reviews + broad final review)
- the workflow is ready for `release-archivist`
